=> list 

l1=["name","jay","age",19]

print(l1[1:6])
list has the same slice method and indexing like string 

the method require are 

sort()
reverse()
append()
insert()
pop()
remove()

=> touple

it will store static value it is immutable

the syntex is  

tu=(1,2,3,4)

if you want to store single value the the syntax is 
tu=(1,)

to check if the value is in the tuple or not 
use "in" keyword 

for eg 

tuple=(1,2,3,4,5)

if(3 in tuple):
    prit("yes the no 3 is there in tuple")


methods require in this are

count()
index()



the practical is in the list.py and tuple.py
